Neural networks are all the rage with the kids these days. News articles are published all the time about how they are being applied with staggering results in image recognition, speech recognition, image synthesis, pattern recognition and other problems.

In this paper we compare a simple feed-forward neural network implementation to popular, well performing more traditional machine learning methods. We conduct experiments against the yelp dataset for classification and regression tasks. The dataset consists of yelp reviews of which the count of 50 different words are given. The regression task consists of predicting how many people found the review useful based on the labeled training data. In the classification task we predict wether the review received over 3 "stars" by users of the site.

Experiments are conducted against these tasks to compare the performance characteristics of the neural network against random forests, a popular battle-tested machine learning method.

This paper is laid out in several sections. In section 2 I give a general overview of the different methods compared. Section 3 describes the experiments performed and section 4 presents the experiment results and section 5 concludes this paper with a discussion of the results of the experiments.
