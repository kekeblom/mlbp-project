\noindent{
This paper compares random forests and feedforward neural networks for classification and regression. An experimental evaluation is done on a dataset of yelp reviews. A theoretical overview of the two methods are given. The implementation of a feedforward neural network is explained. The best performing method for both classification and regression was the feedforward neural network with a small margin.
