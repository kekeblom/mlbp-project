This paper compares random forests and feedforward neural networks for classification and regression. An experimental evaluation is done on a dataset of yelp reviews. A theoretical overview of the different methods is given. The implementation of a feedforward neural network is explained. The best performing method for classification was the feedforward neural network. The random forest turned out to yield better results for regression.
